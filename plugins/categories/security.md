# Security Analysis

Please analyze the security aspects of the following NEAR-based hackathon project. Consider factors such as:

1. **Input Validation**: Are user inputs properly validated?
2. **Authentication and Authorization**: Are authentication and access control mechanisms properly implemented?
3. **Smart Contract Security**: Are there any vulnerabilities in smart contract implementation?
4. **Data Handling**: Is sensitive data handled securely?
5. **Error Handling**: Are errors handled in a way that doesn't reveal sensitive information?
6. **Economic Security**: Are there protections against economic attacks (e.g., frontrunning, reentrancy)?
7. **NEAR-specific Security**: Are NEAR-specific security best practices followed?
8. **Dependencies**: Are there any security issues with dependencies?
