## üèó Architecture

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol

Ava uses Google's A2A protocol for standardized communication between agents:

1. **Task-Based Communication**: Agents communicate by sending task requests and receiving responses
2. **Capability Discovery**: Agents discover each other's capabilities through standardized Agent Cards
3. **Multimodal Messaging**: Supports text, forms, and file exchanges between agents
4. **Secure Collaboration**: Enterprise-grade authentication and authorization

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP provides tools and resources to agents:
- Brave Search for web queries
- GitHub for repository operations
- Filesystem for file management
- And more...

  taskManager: TaskManagerAgent; // Coordinates multi-step operations
  suiAgent: SuiAgent;         // SUI-specific operations
  elizaAgent: ElizaAgent;     // User interaction and strategy explanation
}
```
