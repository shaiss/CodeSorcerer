# Task Manager Agent

The Task Manager Agent is a fundamental component of the Ava Portfolio Manager system, serving as the central coordinator for all agent activities. It orchestrates complex operations by breaking them down into subtasks, delegating them to specialized agents, and tracking their execution through completion.

## Overview

The Task Manager Agent plays a crucial role in the Ava ecosystem by:

- Receiving high-level instructions from users or the Observer Agent
- Breaking complex operations into discrete, executable tasks
- Delegating tasks to specialized agents based on their capabilities
- Tracking task status and ensuring completion
- Handling failures and implementing recovery strategies
- Providing status updates to users and other agents

## Architecture

The Task Manager Agent is built with a layered architecture:

1. **Core Management Layer**: Handles task creation, delegation, and tracking
2. **Task Planning Layer**: Analyzes requests and plans execution strategies
3. **Agent Coordination Layer**: Manages communication with specialized agents
4. **State Management Layer**: Tracks task states and maintains context
5. **Error Recovery Layer**: Handles failure cases and implements retries

## Key Components

### Task Queue

Manages the lifecycle of tasks:
- Prioritizes tasks based on urgency and dependencies
- Ensures sequential execution when necessary
- Manages parallel execution when possible
- Tracks task status and completion

### Task Router

Determines which specialized agent should handle each task:
- Maps task types to capable agents
- Routes tasks to appropriate agents
- Implements fallback strategies when primary agents are unavailable
- Optimizes load distribution across agents

### Context Manager

Maintains context and state throughout multi-step operations:
- Preserves context between related tasks
- Stores intermediate results
- Manages task dependencies
- Enables complex workflows with state preservation

### Recovery System

Handles failures and implements recovery strategies:
- Detects failed tasks
- Implements retry logic with exponential backoff
- Routes to alternative agents when appropriate
- Provides detailed error reporting

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks in the Ava ecosystem follow a well-defined lifecycle:

1. **Creation**: Tasks are created from user requests or system events
2. **Planning**: Complex operations are broken down into subtasks
3. **Delegation**: Tasks are assigned to specialized agents
4. **Execution**: Specialized agents perform the assigned tasks
5. **Monitoring**: Progress is tracked and status updates are provided
6. **Completion/Failure**: Tasks are marked as completed or failed
7. **Recovery**: Failed tasks are retried or alternative approaches are attempted

## Task Types

The Task Manager handles various types of tasks:

### Operation Tasks

Tasks that perform specific operations:
- Trading operations (swaps, liquidity provision)
- Portfolio management (rebalancing, yield farming)
- Data retrieval (market data, position information)
- Analytics (portfolio performance, risk assessment)

### Workflow Tasks

Tasks that coordinate multi-step operations:
- Sequential workflows (operations that must happen in order)
- Conditional workflows (operations with decision points)
- Parallel workflows (operations that can happen simultaneously)
- Recursive workflows (operations that may spawn additional tasks)

### Maintenance Tasks

System maintenance and housekeeping:
- Data synchronization
- Position monitoring
- Health checks
- Performance optimization

## Integration

The Task Manager Agent integrates with the Ava ecosystem through:

1. **Event Bus**: Communicates with all other agents via events
2. **Storage System**: Persists task state and context
3. **Observer Agent**: Receives high-level instructions
4. **Specialized Agents**: Delegates tasks to appropriate agents

## Implementation Details

### Task Delegation

When delegating tasks, the Task Manager:

1. Analyzes the task requirements
2. Identifies capable specialized agents
3. Checks agent availability and capacity
4. Creates a task record with unique ID
5. Sends the task to the selected agent via the Event Bus
6. Sets up monitoring for task completion or failure

```typescript
// Example of task delegation
async delegateTask(task: Task): Promise<string> {
  // Generate unique task ID
  const taskId = generateUniqueId();
  
  // Determine which agent can handle this task
  const targetAgent = this.determineTargetAgent(task);
  
  // Create task record
  const taskRecord = {
    id: taskId,
    type: task.type,
    data: task.data,
    status: 'pending',
    agent: targetAgent,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
  };
  
  // Store task record
  await this.storage.set(`tasks:${taskId}`, taskRecord);
  
  // Send task to target agent
  this.eventBus.emit(`task-manager-${targetAgent}`, {
    taskId,
    task: task.data,
    type: task.type
  });
  
  // Return task ID for tracking
  return taskId;
}
```

### Task Tracking

The Task Manager implements robust task tracking:

```typescript
// Example of task status handling
async handleTaskCompletion(agentName: string, data: any): Promise<void> {
  const { taskId, result, status } = data;
  
  // Retrieve task record
  const taskRecord = await this.storage.get(`tasks:${taskId}`);
  
  if (!taskRecord) {
    console.error(`Unknown task ID: ${taskId}`);
    return;
  }
  
  // Update task status
  taskRecord.status = status;
  taskRecord.result = result;
  taskRecord.updatedAt = new Date().toISOString();
  
  // Store updated record
  await this.storage.set(`tasks:${taskId}`, taskRecord);
  
  // Check if this task is part of a workflow
  if (taskRecord.workflowId) {
    await this.processWorkflowStep(taskRecord);
  }
  
  // Notify observers
  this.eventBus.emit('task-manager-observer', {
    type: 'TASK_UPDATE',
    taskId,
    status,
    result
  });
}
```

## Workflows

The Task Manager supports complex workflows with:

### Sequential Workflows

Tasks that must be executed in sequence:

```typescript
// Example of a sequential workflow
const rebalanceWorkflow = {
  id: 'rebalance-portfolio',
  steps: [
    { type: 'ANALYZE_PORTFOLIO', agent: 'observer' },
    { type: 'CALCULATE_TARGET_ALLOCATIONS', agent: 'observer' },
    { type: 'EXECUTE_TRADES', agent: 'executor' },
    { type: 'VERIFY_REBALANCE', agent: 'observer' }
  ]
};
```

### Conditional Workflows

Workflows with decision points:

```typescript
// Example of a conditional workflow
const yieldOptimizationWorkflow = {
  id: 'optimize-yield',
  steps: [
    { type: 'ANALYZE_YIELD_OPPORTUNITIES', agent: 'observer' },
    { 
      type: 'DECISION',
      condition: (result) => result.bestStrategy === 'lending',
      ifTrue: { type: 'DEPLOY_TO_LENDING', agent: 'cdp-agent' },
      ifFalse: { type: 'DEPLOY_TO_LIQUIDITY_POOL', agent: 'sonic-agent' }
    },
    { type: 'VERIFY_DEPLOYMENT', agent: 'observer' }
  ]
};
```

## Error Handling

The Task Manager implements sophisticated error handling:

- **Retry Logic**: Failed tasks are retried with exponential backoff
- **Alternative Routing**: Tasks can be rerouted to alternative agents
- **Workflow Recovery**: Workflows can recover from individual task failures
- **State Preservation**: Task state is preserved for recovery
- **Error Reporting**: Detailed error reporting for debugging

## Performance Optimization

The Task Manager optimizes performance through:

- **Parallel Execution**: Non-dependent tasks are executed in parallel
- **Task Batching**: Similar tasks are batched for efficiency
- **Priority Queuing**: Tasks are prioritized based on importance
- **Load Balancing**: Work is distributed evenly across agents
- **Resource Management**: System resources are allocated efficiently

## Security Considerations

The Task Manager implements several security measures:

- **Task Validation**: All tasks are validated before execution
- **Authentication**: Tasks are authenticated to prevent unauthorized execution
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging for all task events
- **Access Control**: Tasks are limited to appropriate agents
- **Input Sanitization**: Task inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the Task Manager include:

- **Advanced Workflow Engine**: More sophisticated workflow capabilities
- **Predictive Scheduling**: Anticipating and scheduling tasks proactively
- **Enhanced Recovery Strategies**: More sophisticated error recovery
- **Performance Analytics**: Detailed performance monitoring and optimization
- **Multi-user Support**: Enhanced support for multiple users and accounts
