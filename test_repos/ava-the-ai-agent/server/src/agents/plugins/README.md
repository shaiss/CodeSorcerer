1. Enhanced RecallStorage with:
    * Periodic syncing of chain-of-thought logs
    * Batched storage for efficiency
    * Bucket management per agent
    * Metadata tracking
    * Search capabilities

2. Enhanced IPAgent base class with:
    * Automatic bucket initialization
    * Integrated license storage in Recall
    * Chain-of-thought logging
    * Intelligence search and retrieval
    * Recent thoughts retrieval

3. All agents (TaskManager, Executor, Observer, CDP) now have:
    * Their own dedicated Recall bucket
    * Automatic syncing of chain-of-thought logs
    * Ability to store and retrieve intelligence with metadata
    * Search capabilities across their stored data
    * Integration between ATCP/IP licenses and Recall storage


- The implementation enables:
1. Intelligence Exchange:
    * Agents can store and retrieve intelligence with proper licensing
    * Chain-of-thought logs are automatically synced and can be licensed
    * Intelligence can be searched and retrieved with metadata

2. Knowledge Sharing:
    *   Each agent has its own bucket for storing intelligence
    * Intelligence can be shared with proper licensing terms
    * Metadata tracks ownership and usage rights

3. Memory Management:
    * Periodic syncing ensures no data is lost
    * Batched storage optimizes performance
    * Search capabilities enable efficient retrieval

4. IP Protection:
    * All stored intelligence is linked to ATCP/IP licenses
    * Licenses are stored alongside the intelligence
    * Metadata tracks ownership and permissions

5. The agents can now effectively use Recall for:
    * Storing and retrieving intelligence
    * Sharing knowledge with proper licensing
    * Maintaining chain-of-thought logs
    * Searching across their stored data
    * Managing IP rights and permissions
